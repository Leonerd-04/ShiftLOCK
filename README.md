# ShiftLOCK
A mod for Minecraft Java that lets you use toggle and held crouching at the same time.

The toggle crouch, or shift lock, works kind of like CAPSLOCK:

- Shift lock off -> Shift key functions as normal: holding shift crouches you
- Shift lock on -> Shift key function is inverted: holding shift uncrouches you.

Currently works for 1.19 and 1.20
